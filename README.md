This is my solution to the challenge available at [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-url-shortener) to create a URL shortener application. It has been developed using React and Node.js.

## Running the project

To run the project locally, run the following commands.

```bash
# The below command builds the react project under the `ui` workspace and runs the project on localhost.
npm run dev:ui

# The below command builds and runs the Node.js project under the `api` workspace on localhost.
npm run dev:api

```
