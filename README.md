# Bitlyzer

This is my solution to the challenge available at [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-url-shortener) to create a URL shortener application. It has been developed using React and Node.js.

## Running the application

To successfully run the application, the following must already be installed in the system.

- Node.js
- Npm
- dotenvx (to process environment variables)

If all the above are available in the system, run the following command to start the application.

```bash
npm start
```

This executes a shell script `run.sh`, which starts the `bitlyzer` application. If you are running the application for the first time, run the following command to make sure the shell script is executable.

```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh
```
